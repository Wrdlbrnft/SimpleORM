# SimpleORM

The next generation ORM for Android!

 - **No slow reflection**: SimpleORM uses compile time code generation to ensure high performance
 - **Simple and expressive API**: With just two interfaces and a few annotations you can set everything up! SimpleORM takes care of all the hard work so you can focus on the content you want to save.
 - **Interface based Entities**: SimpleORM works exclusively with interfaces, therefor ensuring high flexibility while at the same time reducing code complexity.
 - **Supports disk encryption**: SimpleORM can encrypt the database using 256 bit AES encryption. The user can unlock the database with a password or her fingerprint! 

Project is currently under active development and **not intended to be used in production**.
